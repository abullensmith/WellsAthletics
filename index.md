# Welcome to my January Project: Investigating Wellesley College Varsity Rosters

For the January Project, I scraped Wellesley Blue Website(https://www.wellesleyblue.com/landing/index) to analyze and look at Wellesley Varsity Rosters from the 2010-11 to 2020-21 seasons. 

## Tools I used

I used google sheets to scrape the rosters, and I used Selenium, a python library, to scrape the coaches information from the website. In my repository, you can find the csv files I made of the rosters, and a juypter notebook scraping the coaches information.

### Interesting Finds

## Look to the Future

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/abullensmith/WellsAthletics/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
